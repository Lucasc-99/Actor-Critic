<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction
This project contains an implementation of the Advantage Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Method, and includes an example of it being used to solve Cart-Pole.
Cart-Pole is a game in which the player (in this case, our model) attempts to balance a pole on a cart.

## Implementation Details
TODO: Discuss the A2C method and its implementation in this repo

## Built With

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
